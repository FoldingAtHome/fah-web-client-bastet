      These settings affect all of the machines linked to your account.

  .setting
    HelpBalloon(name="Avatar")
      p An avatar is an optional image to represent you on Folding@home.
      p.
        The ideal avatar is 128x128 pixels.
        If you choose a larger image, it will be automatically scaled down.
        Your avatar's final size must not be less than 32 pixels in either
        dimension.

        :min-width="32", :min-height="32", ref="avatar")

  CommonSettings(:config="account", ref="common")

  .setting
    HelpBalloon(name="Node"): p.
      A Folding@home node helps you connect to your remote clients.
      Unless otherwise instructed, it's best to leave the default value.

    input(v-model="account.node", :class="{error: !node_valid}")

  .setting
    HelpBalloon(name="Token")
      p.
        A token is used to connect your remote clients to your account.  You
        can pass your account token to a client to cause it to link to your
        account.  Once a machine is linked it will show up as one of your
        machines in your account.

      p.
        Anyone with your account token can link machines to your
        account.  Once you've used an account token it's a good idea to
        generate a new one.  Anytime you generate a new account token the
        previous account tokens are no longer valid.  But any machines which
        are already linked to you account will remain linked.

      p.
        If a client is running locally on the same machine you've logged in
        to your Folding@home account on, it will automatically be linked to
        your account.
