    HelpBalloon(name="Scheduling"): p.
      These settings control when Folding@home runs.

  .setting
    HelpBalloon(name="Only When Idle"): p.
      Enable folding only when your machine is idle.  I.e. when the mouse
      and keyboard are not being used.  Note, that folding will not start
      when idle if your machine goes to sleep first.

    input(v-model="config.on_idle", type="checkbox",
      title="Only fold when machine is idle")

  template(v-if="$util.version_less('8.3.1', version)")
    .setting
      HelpBalloon(name="While On Battery"): p.
        If this option is disabled, folding will pause when your machine is
        running on battery power.

      input(v-model="config.on_battery", type="checkbox",
        title="Allow folding when machine is on battery")

    .setting
      HelpBalloon(name="Keep Awake"): p.
        When enabled, this option prevents your machine from going to sleep
        while folding is active and your machine is not on battery power.

      input(v-model="config.keep_awake", type="checkbox",
        title="Prevent system sleep when folding and not on battery")

fieldset.settings.view-panel
  legend
    HelpBalloon(name="Resource Usage"): p.
      These settings control the usage of your machines compute resources.

  .setting
    HelpBalloon(name="CPUs")
      p Choose how many CPU cores Folding@home should try to utilize.
      p.
        Reduce the number of CPUs allocate to folding if your system runs
        too slow while Folding@home is running.  Set to the maximum to earn
        the most points.  However, you may also consider reserving a few
        CPUs if you are also doing GPU folding.  GPU folding may also need
        some CPU power.

    .cpus-input
      input(v-model.number="config.cpus", :min="0", type="range",
        :max="cpus", v-if="0 < cpus")
      span {{config.cpus}} of {{cpus}}

  .setting
    HelpBalloon(name="GPUs")
      p Choose which of your GPUs to run Folding@home on.
      p.
        Some GPUs are not supported by Folding@home either because they are
        too old, too new, the necessary driver software is missing from you
        computer or the GPU has known bugs that prevent folding from working
        correctly.  If your GPU is not supported you will not be able to
        enable it.

      p Either CUDA, OpenCL or both is required for folding.

  legend
    HelpBalloon(name="Advanced"): p.
      These settings are for testing Folding@home.

  .setting
    HelpBalloon(name="Beta Projects"): p.
      Enable folding of beta projects.  Beta projects are in testing and may
      fail and cause you to lose points.

    input(v-model="config.beta", type="checkbox",
      title="Enable beta projects")

  .setting
    HelpBalloon(name="Project Key"): p.
      Project keys are used for internal testing of folding projects.
      Unless you are specially instructed by a Folding@home researcher to
      use a project key, leave this field set to zero.

    input(v-model="config.key", type="number", title="Project key",

  .setting
    HelpBalloon(name="Enable CUDA"): p.
      Enable CUDA support.  Normally this should be left enabled.  Disabling
      CUDA is used for testing purposes.
